Data Source

All data has been downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip The .zip file create the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory which contains the following files:

activity_labels.txt
features_info.txt
features.txt
README.txt
test (directory)
train (directory)
Directory "test" contains the files

subject_test.txt
X_test.txt
y_test.txt
Inertial Signals (directory)
Directory "train" contains the files

subject_train.txt
X_train.txt

Script Details

Main script "run_analysis.R" identify the current working directory and set to the correct WD if not already on it. This same script reads the .TXT files to merge them. Files used for the project are:

"UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt"
"UCI HAR Dataset/test/x_test.txt"
"UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt"
"UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt"
"UCI HAR Dataset/train/x_train.txt"
"UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt"
Generating as internal results 3 datasets with the merged test and train information:

subject_out
x_out
y_out
Then the x_out, subject_out and y_out are merged together to create a single dataset named as "collection"

Inertial signals files are not considered in this initial stage, so the script ends up with the above only.

Perform the required operations on these datasets: Create a file with "mean" and "standard deviation" values only, output file is at Working Directory with name "TidyDataOut.txt"

The second output file requested with the mean on each variable separated by "activity" is also in the working directory and the file name is "TidyMeanOut.txt"
